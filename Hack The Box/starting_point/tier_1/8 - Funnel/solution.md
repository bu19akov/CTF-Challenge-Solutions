#### 2. What is the name of the directory that is available on the FTP server?

> mail_backup

#### 3. What is the default account password that every new member on the "Funnel" team should change as soon as possible?

```sh

#### 5. Which service is running on TCP port 5432 and listens only on localhost?

```sh
$ nmap -p5432 -sV 10.129.228.195
Starting Nmap 7.94 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-03-02 20:17 CET
Nmap scan report for 10.129.228.195
Host is up (0.034s latency).

PORT     STATE  SERVICE    VERSION
5432/tcp closed postgresql

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .

```

> postgresql

#### 6. Since you can't access the previously mentioned service from the local machine, you will have to create a tunnel and connect to it from your machine. What is the correct type of tunneling to use? remote port forwarding or local port forwarding?

> local port forwarding

#### 7. What is the name of the database that holds the flag?

*(Port forwarding from local port `1234` to server port `5432`)*

```sh
$ ssh -L 1234:localhost:5432 christine@10.129.228.195
christine@funnel:~$
```

*(Check our local port forwarding in other window)*

```sh
$ sudo lsof -nP -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN
...
ssh       97861 vladimir    5u  IPv6 0xe03a0329f4a3fc11      0t0  TCP [::1]:1234 (LISTEN)
ssh       97861 vladimir    6u  IPv4 0xe03a0329e6d79f11      0t0  TCP 127.0.0.1:1234 (LISTEN)
```

*(We can now interact with the `PostgreSQL` service running locally on the target machine)*

```sh
$ psql -U christine -h localhost -p 1234
Password for user christine:
